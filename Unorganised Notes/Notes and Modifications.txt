Things that aren't in the other notes but may be important:

1) Laziness
	Currently, my organisation on this project is in shambles.
	Documentation is imaginary, at best.

2) Backpowering
	If the connected USB port remains powered when PC is off, the Arduino will remain on.
	Add a diode from the 12v molex to Vin on the Arduino
	- this will prevent backpowering to the PC 12v rail.
	Ideally, a reset trigger needs to be put in place when the 12v powers up on computer reboot.

3) Wire bodging
	As shown in one of the pictures, the output wiring from the ATTiny85s are wrong.
	This requires a fix in the PCB design but this hasn't been done yet.

4) Fritzing
	The Adafruit parts library was used.
	This may have been updated.

5) Python libraries
	Installation of psutil and GPUtil are required for pc_status_130 to display all information.
	PySerial is used.

6) Arduino libraries
	LCD by Blackhawk
	Adafruit BusIO and PWM driver for PCA9685
	IRRemote
